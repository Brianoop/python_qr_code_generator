Hello, welcome to my simple Python QRCODE generator program.

This is a very simple program that uses the following dependencies:

asgiref==3.5.2
colorama==0.4.5
Django==4.1.1
image==1.5.33
Pillow==9.2.0
qrcode==7.3.1
six==1.16.0
sqlparse==0.4.3
tzdata==2022.4


Use pip install to install these packages before running index.py

A requirements.txt file is included.

To install from requirements.txt
Run pip install -r requirements.txt

One last thing, it is a good practice to always use a virtual environment for every python project.
